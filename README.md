# Traverlers Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

This modeling competition is a project for the class STAT 8501 Advancned Regression Technique, hosted by an insurance company called [Travelers](https://www.travelers.com). The task was to predict which insurance claim was fraudulent. The details of this competition can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/2018-trv-statistical-modeling-competition-umn). My team ended up in the 2nd place (there were 8 teams in total).

This repository included my report of this analysis, our presentation slides, and some of the code my team used.
